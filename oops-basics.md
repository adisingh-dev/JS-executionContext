# 4 pillars of OOPS?
✅ Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance

# what is procedural programming and what are its downsides?
✅ procedural programming is a programming paradigm that segregates the code in fn and variables. we have a set of data in the form of variables and fn that operate on them
✅ the downside is that when trying to change a fn, several other fn break leading to speghetti code. Each fn has so much interdependencies that it gets harder to track each fn individually
because they are decoupled

# define 4 concepts of oops?
✅ encapsulation: grouping related variables and fn together in a single object to represent a real world entity
✅ abstraction: hiding away data members and methods from outside access to make a simple interface avoiding unnecesary complexity and reducing impact of change 
✅ inheritance: it eliminates redundant code by making objects inherit the properties and methods of parent/generic objects
✅ polymorphism: ability to reuse same method names with different parameters by eliminating the need of if-else ladder and switch-case statements
